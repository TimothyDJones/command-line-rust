     1	The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
     2	Is lust in action: and till action, lust
     3	Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
     4	Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;


     5	Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight;
     6	Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
     7	Past reason hated, as a swallowed bait,
     8	On purpose laid to make the taker mad.


     9	Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
    10	Had, having, and in quest to have extreme;
    11	A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;
    12	Before, a joy proposed; behind a dream.


    13	All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
    14	To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
